                You have decided to design a fashion chatbot that helps people pick out their fashion preferences. Your bot can gauge what types of clothes and accessories the user might like.

                Your chatbot should ask the user the following (minimum requirements for the grader) and then give answers depending on the answers the user inputs:
<br>
                at least 6 questions<br>
                at least 3 if-elif-else statements<br>
                the use of the random module and randomly generated numbers <br>Based on these criteria, some responses will be based on what the user types and some will be based on random numbers.

                It was a stressful project but when it was complete I was happy that the code worked well together. The difficulty was to keep track of the number of variables and what the chatbot will say when the user input yes, no, or any other answer. After completing it, it was fun to talk to the Chatbot. To edit the code, I would have added more questions to talk to the user.

                I enjoyed this project because it was centered around one of my favorite subjects, Math. It was fun to figure out how the code should work. Working with the input function, variable, for loops and the modulus was a good way for me to practice my skills in coding and Math. A challenge was to make the user determine the number of times the program should  check if the number is divisible by 3. To make the code more challenging, I would add an input in which the user can ask what number they can divide by.

                You must use at least one user-defined (custom) function to create musical sections for your ringtone.

                Your ringtone should be a minimum of 60 seconds and a maximum of 90 seconds

                Your ringtone should include a sound clip found in the EarSketch sound library.

                I had a blast while working on this project. I wanted to make a funky and unique beat that would stand out when played. I wanted the user to enjoy and dance to their ringtone rather than be annoyed at how it sounds. The hardest part of the project was to find beats that blend well together and conveys my theme well. It was a tough task but I believe that I completed it well. The part I enjoyed the most was hearing the product after every choice I made. I felt proud that I could make a song so well put together. I would like to make a different song that had more planning and thought put into the process of making the song.

                <h4><b>Reflection</b></h4>
                <br>
                <h6>
                  This is one of my favorite projects because I had the opportunity to be as creative as I pleased. I designed a pirate named Hack. It was very difficult to estimate the correct placement of different shapes.

                  This program was to create a game in which the goal is to eliminate all of the bricks with a ball while keeping the ball bouncing. 
                </h5>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Reflection</b></h4>

                  I did everything correct in the code but unfortunately, the module was corrupted, which resulted in my work not working. It is disappointing because the brick-breaking game is one of my favorite apps to play. I believed that I was going to get the opportunity to code something I loved, but I was wrong. I enjoyed coding, but it was impossible to get the full experience without seeing the output.
